# HTTPS and HTTP

To Access weather api that uses http, meanwhile my website is on https, I used heroku proxy. (in front of the link request.)

# SPA Issues

On Apache Http server, in .htaccess added some settings. It is to access previously reloaded page. Start point is index.html

# Version Control

I can change default values for color. In AuthProvider.jsx -> useEffect = I get stored values of items and color from localstorage and put it in default state <b>tasks</b> (that I changed default color values in before).
